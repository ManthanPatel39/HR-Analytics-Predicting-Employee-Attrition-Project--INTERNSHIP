HR Analytics – Predicting Employee Attrition Project -INTERNSHIP
About This Project
Employee attrition (people leaving a company) can cost businesses a lot — from lost productivity to recruiting expenses. This project aims to understand why employees leave by analyzing HR data and building a model that predicts who might quit in the future. With these insights, companies can take proactive steps to keep their best talent.

What I Did
Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and converting text fields (like department names) into numbers so the model can understand them.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Investigated trends like which departments have the highest turnover, age groups most likely to leave, and how overtime and job satisfaction affect attrition.

Modeling:
Built a logistic regression model that predicts whether an employee will leave based on factors like age, overtime status, years at the company, and job satisfaction.

Visualization:
Created an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes attrition trends by department, education, gender, and more, helping HR easily spot problem areas.

Key Findings
Sales and R&D departments experience the highest employee turnover.

Younger employees (especially under 35) and those working overtime tend to leave more often.

Job dissatisfaction and overtime hours are strong predictors of attrition.

How Well Does the Model Perform?
The logistic regression model showed strong performance with good accuracy and clear predictive power, verified through metrics like the confusion matrix and ROC curve.

Recommendations
Reduce excessive overtime to improve work-life balance and retain employees.

Focus retention strategies on high-risk groups like younger employees and certain departments.

Regularly check employee satisfaction and address concerns proactively.

Tools Used
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib) for analysis and modeling.

Tableau for creating interactive dashboards.

Jupyter Notebook for documenting the workflow.
