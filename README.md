# 📊 HR Analytics – Predicting Employee Attrition

## 🔍 About This Project
Employee attrition (people leaving a company) can cost businesses a lot — from lost productivity to recruiting expenses. This project analyzes HR data and builds a predictive model to identify employees likely to leave, helping companies retain talent proactively.

## 🛠️ What I Did
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical data for modeling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Discovered key patterns in attrition by department, age, job satisfaction, and overtime.  
- **Modeling:** Built a logistic regression model predicting attrition with strong performance.  
- **Visualization:** Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard for easy exploration of attrition trends.

## 📈 Key Findings
- High turnover in Sales and R&D departments.  
- Younger employees (under 35) and those working overtime more likely to leave.  
- Job dissatisfaction and overtime are major attrition predictors.

## 📊 Model Performance
The logistic regression model demonstrated good accuracy and discrimination power, verified via confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Reduce overtime and improve work-life balance.  
- Target retention efforts on younger staff and departments with high turnover.  
- Regularly assess and improve employee satisfaction.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)  
- Tableau  
- Jupyter Notebook
